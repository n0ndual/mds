* Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg
** Abstract
it achieves high utilization by combining admission control, efficient task-packing, over-commitment, and machine sharing with process-level performance isolation.
we present a summary of the Borg system architecture and features, important design decisions, a quantitative analysis of some of its policy decisions, and a qualitative examination of lessons learned from a decade of operational experience with it.
** Introduction
*** benefits
1. hides the details of resource management and failure handling so its users can focus on application development instead.
2. operates with very high reliability and availability, and supports applications that do the same
3. lets us run workloads on tens of thousands of machines effectively
*** how to compare with others?
borg is not the first system to address these issues, but it's one of the few operating at this scale, with this degree of resiliency and completeness.
